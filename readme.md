## 🧠 How It Works

The calculator logic is written in plain JavaScript:
- **`appendNumber()`** — adds digits to the display  
- **`setOperator()`** — stores the current number and selected operator  
- **`calculate()`** — performs the math using the `operate()` helper function  
- **`clearDisplay()`** — resets everything to start a new calculation
